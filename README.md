This project aims to develop a sentiment analysis model using a dataset of movie reviews to classify them as positive or negative. The model is trained on labeled reviews to learn patterns indicative of sentiment, and its accuracy is evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
